# AlphaVantage
I coded using Jupyter Notebook, so thats why the formatting can be a bit off. Otherwise the only things you need
to run this code successfully is a to update the dates in the "Columns.csv", download an API key from Alphavantage 
and lastly find a ticker list and format it in a way that the first column has your tickers. 

I hope this helps, if you happen to have any questions message me on Linkedin
