# AlphaVantage
This is a code i wrote to download stock data for free for a long list of tickers (000's). I always wanted to get my hands
on data, but couldnt find it in the format that i wanted. So this code does exactly that by pulling large amounts
of data, transposing it and cleaning any sort of missed values. I hope overall that i can help you to get access to data
for your own research as this is what its about. This is not 100% perfect, but its free.

I coded using Jupyter Notebook, so thats why the formatting can be a bit off. Otherwise the only things you need
to run this code successfully is a to update the dates in the "Columns.csv" (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS AM/PM),
download an API key from Alphavantage and lastly find a ticker list and format it in a way that the first column has your tickers. 

I hope this helps, if you happen to have any questions message me on Linkedin
